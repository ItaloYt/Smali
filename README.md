# Smali Environment
This project was created with the purpose of learning
smali, so it has a predefined makefile to compile our projects.
`Makefile_example` is the makefile used across all examples
`manifest_example.mf` is the jar manifest used across all examples

All the files are commented so you can learn from them

## How to build examples
You can build examples using the following commands:
```
make compile;
make recompile;
```
There's gonna be two .jar files at out/ folder, the `lib.jar` is the jar generated by jar commands and .java files, `slib.jar` is the jar generated by the smali code

## Prerequisites
